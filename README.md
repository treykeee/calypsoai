# LLM Security and AI Security Features

## Introduction

LLM (Large Language Models) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) are rapidly evolving fields that have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. However, with this potential comes the need for increased security measures to protect against potential threats and vulnerabilities. In this document, we will explore the various security features of LLM and AI, and how they can be used to enhance security and protect against potential threats.

## Section 1: LLM Security

LLM models are powerful tools that can be used for a variety of applications, including natural language processing, machine translation, and image recognition. However, these models are also vulnerable to attacks such as adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model stealing. To protect against these threats, various security features have been developed, including:

- Adversarial training
- Data sanitization
- Model compression
- Differential privacy

## Section 2: AI Security Features

AI systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, from virtual assistants to self-driving cars. However, these systems are also vulnerable to attacks such as data poisoning, model stealing, and backdoor attacks. To protect against these threats, various security features have been developed, including:

- Explainability
- Robustness
- Privacy
- Accountability
